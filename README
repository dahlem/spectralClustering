This project is an implementation of spectral clustering using the
unnormalised (and sparse) graph Laplacian (in upper triangular form)
solving the generalised eigenvalue problem using arpack++. For a good
tutorial on spectral clustering see

CONFIGURATION

The Makefile contains the hard-coded references to the required
software packages, which include boost, arpack++, and SuiteSparse. You
would need to install those packages and point to the appropriate
libraries and include folders.

Type "make" to compile the project. This will create an executable
"spectralClustering".


EXECUTION

The executable accepts a number of command-line parameters, which have
to be passed in:

./spectralClustering <resultsDir> <nonZeroW> <nonZeroD> <D> <W> <numEigenvalues>

 - resultsDir: the directory to write the eigen values and vectors to

 - nonZeroW: The W matrix contains the pair-wise distances. This
             parameter gives the number of non-zero entries

 - nonZeroD: The D matrix is a diagonal matrix, where the entries are
             computed as d_i = \sum_j w_ij. All diagonals have to be
 	     non-zero. This parameter gives the number of non-zero
 	     elements, which is equivalent to the dimension of the
 	     problem.
 
 - D: Is the diagonal matrix in a CSV file of the form:

      i,d_i

      where i is the row index (starting at 1) and d_i is the diagonal
      value

 - W: is the weighted graph of the pair-wise distances in a CSV file
      of the form:

      i,j,w_ij

      where i and j are the rows and columns respectively and the w_ij
      is the distance value between object i and j

 - numEigenvalues: This parameter specifies how many eigenvalues with
                   the smallest magnitude should be computed.
